## Introduction <br />
Fifa is without a doubt one of the most popular games of all time. In Career Mode, you can create or manage a team of your wish, transfer and create a whole empire. The code uses linear regression to predict player's prices.
## Why use it <br />
Many times it happens that we would like to get an accurate prediction on how much we should bid on a player, for example. The possibilities are endless though; you can easily tailor the code to your needs
## How to use it <br />
Using the fifa21 data csv file, you can find every attribute if you use the head() function. From there, you can choose which one you would like to include. 
## Self-reflection <br />
The project was very interesting and I was hooked the whole time. It was excellent for helping me getting back to Python.
